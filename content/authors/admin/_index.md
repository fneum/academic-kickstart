I am an energy system modeller at the [Department of Digital Transformation in Energy Systems](https://www.ensys.tu-berlin.de) at the [Technische Universität Berlin (TUB)](https://www.tu.berlin).

Previously, I pursued a PhD at the [Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics](https://www.iai.kit.edu/) of the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://kit.edu) focussing on
computational and near-optimal trade-offs in renewable electricity system modelling.

I studied Sustainable Energy Systems at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/msc-taught/msc-sustainable-energy-systems) and industrial engineering centred on computational methods in energy research at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.wiwi.kit.edu/english/studiengangWiingBSc.php). I also briefly worked at [Fraunhofer ISI](https://www.isi.fraunhofer.de/).

I am a member of the [Open Energy Modelling Initiative](http://openmod-initiative.org/), which promotes openness and transparency in energy system modelling and I also co-develop open-source software:

- [PyPSA](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA) is a power system analysis toolbox written in Python.
- [PyPSA-Eur](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA-Eur) is a workflow to build an open model of the European electricity system.
- [PyPSA-Eur-Sec](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA-Eur-Sec) is the sector-coupling extension of PyPSA-Eur.

Since 2022 I teach a course on [Data Science in Energy System Modelling](https://fneum.github.io/data-science-for-esm/intro.html) at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin).
