I currently pursue my PhD in the Energy System Modelling Group of [Dr. Tom Brown](https://nworbmot.org/) at the [Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics](https://www.iai.kit.edu/) of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where I develop methodologies to improve power network representations in cross-sectoral decarbonised energy system models that co-optimise generation, transmission and storage expansion.

I studied Sustainable Energy Systems at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/msc-taught/msc-sustainable-energy-systems) and industrial engineering centred on energy informatics and energy technologies at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.wiwi.kit.edu/english/studiengangWiingBSc.php). I also had a brief intermezzo at [Fraunhofer ISI](https://www.isi.fraunhofer.de/).

I am a member of the [Open Energy Modelling Initiative](http://openmod-initiative.org/), which promotes openness and transparency in energy system modelling and I also co-develop open-source software:

- __PyPSA__ is a power system analysis toolbox written in Python. It's available at [github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA) and documented at [pypsa.readthedocs.io](https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/).
- __PyPSA-Eur__ is is an open model dataset of the European power system at the transmission network level that covers the full ENTSO-E area. It's available at [github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA-Eur) and documented at [pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/). The dataset of pre-built networks is available at [10.5281/zenodo.3601882](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3601882).
