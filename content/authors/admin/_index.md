I am currently pursuing my PhD in the Energy System Modelling Group of [Dr. Tom Brown](https://nworbmot.org/) at the [Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics](https://www.iai.kit.edu/) of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where I develop methodologies to improve power network representations in cross-sectoral decarbonised energy system models that co-optimise generation, transmission and storage expansion.

Previously, I did research at the [Fraunhofer ISI](https://www.isi.fraunhofer.de/), after I had finished my studies of Sustainable Energy Systems at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/msc-taught/msc-sustainable-energy-systems). I completed my Master in 2017 with a [dissertation](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.13347.96805) focussed on the optimal scheduling of electric vehicles in distribution networks under uncertainty. Before that, I studied industrial engineering centred on energy informatics and energy technologies at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.wiwi.kit.edu/english/studiengangWiingBSc.php). I wrote my Bachelor [thesis](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.20058.85440) on heat pump scheduling using genetic algorithms at the [Research Centre for Information Technology (FZI)](https://www.fzi.de/en/about-us/organisation/research-divisions/ispe/?contentId_=2257).
