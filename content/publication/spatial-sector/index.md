Electricity transmission expansion has suffered many delays in Europe in recent
decades, despite its importance for integrating renewable electricity into the
energy system. A hydrogen network which reuses the existing fossil gas network
would not only help supply demand for low-emission fuels, but could also help to
balance variations in wind and solar energy across the continent and thus avoid
power grid expansion. We pursue this idea by varying the allowed expansion of
electricity and hydrogen grids in net-zero CO2 scenarios for a sector-coupled
European energy system with high shares of renewables and self-sufficient
supply. We cover the electricity, buildings, transport, agriculture, and
industry sectors across 181 regions and model every third hour of a year. With
this high spatio-temporal resolution, we can capture bottlenecks in transmission
and the variability of demand and renewable supply. Our results show a
consistent benefit of a pan-continental hydrogen backbone that connects
high-yield regions with demand centers, synthetic fuel production and geological
storage sites. Developing a hydrogen network reduces system costs by up to 6%,
with highest benefits when electricity grid reinforcements cannot be realised.
Between 58% and 66% of this backbone could be built from repurposed natural gas
pipelines. However, we find that hydrogen networks can only partially substitute
for power grid expansion, and that both can achieve strongest cost savings of
12% together.
