Renewable energy sources are likely to build the backbone of the future global energy system.One important key to a successful energy transition is to analyse the weather-dependent en-ergy outputs of existing and eligible renewable resources.atliteis an open Python softwarepackage for retrieving global historical weather data and converting it to power generationpotentials and time series for renewable energy technologies like wind turbines or solar photo-voltaic panels based on detailed mathematical models. It further provides weather-dependentoutput on the demand side like building heating demand and heat pump performance. Thesoftware is optimized to aggregate data over multiple large regions with user-defined weight-ings based on land use or energy yield.
