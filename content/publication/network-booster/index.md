Using corrective actions to overcome network loading when single lines fail
has the potential to free up network capacity that is otherwise underused in
preventive N-1 security strategies. We investigate the impact on renewable
integration of a corrective network security strategy, whereby storage or other
flexibility assets are used to correct overloading that results from line
outages. In a 50-bus model of the German power system utilizing these
flexibility assets, so-called network boosters (NB), we find significant cost
savings for the integration of renewable energy of up to 0.85 billion euros per
year. While previous literature has focused on the potential savings in the
short-term operation, we focus on the long-term benefits in systems with high
shares of renewable energy sources, where the capacities and dispatch of
generation and NB are optimised. We demonstrate the benefits of NB for various
shares of renewable energy, NB and flexibility costs, as well as different
allowed levels of temporary overloading the lines in both (i) a sequential
model, where long-run generation investments are optimised separately from the
NB capacities, and (ii) a simultaneous model, where generation is co-optimised
with NB investment so that mixed preventive-corrective approaches are possible.
